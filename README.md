# react-clicky

## Project Goals

- Use REACT to create a game that stores images clicked in state.
- Break up application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user click events
- Check if you click the same image twice
- Keep track of user's score, score should reset back to 0 when an image is clicked twice
- Shuffle Pictuers after each click
- Win when you have clicked on all images only once
